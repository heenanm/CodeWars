# CodeWars

CodeWars is a repo to store all the solutions to the CodeWars Kata's and the respective Unit tests as they are completed.

## Completed Kata's

[Complementery DNA](https://github.com/heenanm/CodeWars/blob/master/src/CodeWars/ComplementaryDna.cs) 
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA.
You need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all.

[If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://github.com/heenanm/CodeWars/blob/master/src/CodeWars/CantSleepCountSheep.cs)
Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". 
Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.
